# Boxflow

Boxflow is a layout engine implementing flexboxes as well as others in Zig.
It aims to be universally usable for applications such as GUIs and window managers.

# Usage

To compile Boxflow, you need to use the latest master version of the Zig compiler.
If Boxflow stops compiling on master Zig, please bug me about it.

If you want to use Boxflow, a good starting point is looking at `src/Box.zig`. It's the main interface of Boxflow.
I hope to document all types extensively.
